# skald-godot

Skald implementation for Godot. Will eventually be an official app plugin. For now, it's an autoload file that you can fork and include directly as a submodule.

## Installation

1. Use this repo or, if you want to customize it, fork this repo and use that.
2. In terminal, navigate to the folder you would like the `skald-godot` project folder to live in, and enter this command:
	`git submodule add https://github.com/tsraveling/skald-godot.git`
3. This will download the `skald-godot` repo as a folder. You can then pull new versions down from origin by using `git` within the `skald-godot` folder. For now, commits on the `main` branch will be tagged with version numbers.
4. In your Godot project, register the `skald-godot/Godot.gd` file as an autoload.

## Usage
